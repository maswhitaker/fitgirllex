      <h3>She was unstoppable. Not because she did not have failures or doubts, but because she continued on despite them. - Beau Taplin</h3>

    <p>
      I am not defined by what the world thinks of me. I am not defined by who the world tells me I should be. I am defined by my own dedication and perservearance to become the best version of myself as possible. I strive to push limits, live outside my comfort zone and crush any doubts or fears that may arise. I have nothing to prove to you or anyone else out there; it's me vs. me every day.
    </p>

    <p>
    A little bit about myself- I currently reside in the beautiful state of North Carolina. I'm a beach bum at heart, but that crisp NC mountain air is hard to beat. I grew up playing soccer (like every waking moment of the day) and was positive that I would be the next Mia Ham. Unfortunately, the closest I got to that dream was having a black lab named Mia. I came from a small high school and was pretty stoked to get recruited to play Division 1 soccer. My soccer days are now over, but I have replaced that passion with a new one. Its as simple as this. I do NOT want to be ordinary. In fact, I REFUSE to be ordinary. The best thing about this lifestyle that I have adapted is that there is no final destination. I will always be a work in progress. I believe that there will always be new challenges and new limits to push.
    </p>

    <p>

    So here is my challenge for you, yes YOU. Believe in yourself; expect more from yourself; push yourself, and most of all, NEVER give up on yourself. I'm not going to lie, the journey to a transformed lifestyle isn't easy. There is no secret pill, or magical diet that will get you there either. It takes dedication, and commitment. Without those two things this journey will be a waste of your time, in fact you should probably just X out of this page right now. But if you are willing to trust the process and give your all, no matter what, then let me tell ya, your "dream body" will be the least of your excitement. The rush of confidence and the self-esteem boost that comes along with a transformed lifestyle and body is what its all about for me. Just knowing that your dedication is what got you here - you vs. you.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am here to inspire you with my imperfections. I want so badly for everyone to have this oozing passion within them and just spread it all around the world. I will never apologize for my enthusiasm. I love what I do and I love sharing my passions with others. I now realize how important it is to be an enthusiast in life. If you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it, and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be.
